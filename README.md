# Liver Damage Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to automatically detect liver damage from medical images using advanced deep learning techniques. It classifies liver conditions into three categories: **Normal Liver**, **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**, and **Cholangiocarcinoma (CC)**.

# Project Overview

Liver cancer is one of the most common and deadly diseases worldwide. Early detection can drastically improve treatment outcomes. This model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high-accuracy multi-class classification of liver conditions based on image data.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled liver images across three classes:
- **Normal**
- **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**
- **Cholangiocarcinoma (CC)**

> *Due to medical data restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. Please contact the project author or use your own dataset.*


# Results

The model achieved strong performance with high accuracy, precision, and recall across all three classes. Visualizations and confusion matrices are provided in the `notebooks/` folder.



# Future Work

- Model explainability with Grad-CAM or SHAP
- Dataset expansion
- Web interface for live predictions
